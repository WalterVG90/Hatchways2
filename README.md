### Here is a breakdown of the five parts of this App :+1:

* 1) Fetch data from a JSON API
--> DONE!!!!
* 2) Style the app using HTML and CSS.
--> DONE!!!!
* 3) Create a text field, and filter the list of data by Name.
--> DONE!!!!
* 4) Create expandable views.
--> DONE!!!!
* 5) Create Tag Input & And add Tag Search
--> DONE!! 
  * Tags are delayed to display on screen BUT will show up after several inputs
  * Name and Tag search function well, however I did not have time to impletment the combined search
